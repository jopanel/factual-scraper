Hello all

This was built for V2 of Factual. It adhered to the rules and regulations of the free level account. This code is purely for educational purposes. 

As v2 is obsolete and v3 is available. It is pay to play only. If you currently pay for factual data and have v3, with a bit of modification you could use this. 

This code will run through each zip code and each page of the zip code if more than 50 results are available, then save the data in a database until all United States zip codes are finished. It required being ran at least twice as running once would hit the 10,000 request limit. 

Also if you're reading this Factual people. I followed all of your rules and terms of service and never broke your personal rules. I made this purely for a bored personal coding challenge.
